## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project was mostly review of the elements of the qr and blog card projects.  I enjoyed making it.  Styling the anchor tag is a new element for these projects.  When I started thinking about the HTML I wondered if the social links were buttons or links.  I decided they should be links because buttons should be for some type of action, usually with a form.  The anchor tag is going to be a link to another location.  

The grey on grey color scheme seems problematic to me.  Not much contrast there, but the hover effect has great contrast.

### Continued development

Based on completing this project, I will look to continue developing in the following areas:
-Semantic HTML
-Accessibility
